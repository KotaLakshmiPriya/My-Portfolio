# My-Portfolio
This repository contains a collection of my web development projects, including both frontend and full-stack applications. Projects showcase skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB, covering real-world use cases like weather apps, expense tracking, form handling, and responsive UI design.
